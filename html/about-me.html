				<div class="myBio">
				<p>I have three years IT experience which I am souping up through We Can Code IT's full stack development boot camp. Seeking return to project management/ business analyst position where creativity and research thrive in a team environment. Accomplished and enthusiastic in creating strong customer relations and quick to master new technologies.</p>
				<p>
				Internationally experienced and culturally malleable educator having taught in Frankfurt, Germany for two years to students from over 30 countries. Afterwards I taught in charter school catering to English Language Learners from East Africa and South America, and at another inner-city school near Whitehall. I have become a cultural chameleon: able to learn, understand, blend, and relate to those I teach.</p>
